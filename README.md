This project aims to analyze hotel booking data from City and Resort hotels across the years 2015 to 2017, focusing on key performance indicators such as total bookings, cancellations, guest types, room status accuracy, and monthly trends.

Final conclusion as per available data

The hotel booking analysis shows that City Hotels received 79,330 bookings, nearly double that of Resort Hotels (40,060), but also faced higher cancellations at 33,102, compared to 11,122 for Resort Hotels. Among guest types, Two-Adults had the most bookings (81,560) and the highest cancellations (32,424), highlighting them as a key segment for intervention. Cancellations were notably higher for bookings with correct room status (43,422) compared to incorrect status (802). Monthly trends reveal peak bookings and cancellations between May and August, with August alone recording 13,877 bookings and 5,239 cancellations. Year-wise, 2016 had the highest activity with 56,707 guests and 20,337 cancellations, while 2017 saw a dip to 40,687 guests and 15,745 cancellations. Despite fluctuations in volume, the cancellation rate remained high (~37â€“39%), indicating a need for improved guest engagement and retention strategies.
